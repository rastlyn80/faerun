* D:\Faerun\scripts\misc\skillwin.src 
This is where the skill gump happens. 

* D:\Faerun\scripts\misc\oncreate.src 
This is where the character creation happens.
There's a critical loop on creation that might need to be addressed at some point.
Implement racial traits in the AssignRaceModifiers (resistance for Dragonborn, Dwarven toughness, etc)

* Check if SYSEVENT_SPEECH is fired when the character is squelched.
That could be an amazing way of controlling languages, etc.
