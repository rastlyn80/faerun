            the Region Spawner:</big><br>
          I will sometimes refer to the spawn system as the "region spawner"
          because that is what it does, spawns regions. Some people also call
          these types of spawn systems as <i>area spawners</i>. I will also use
          "facet" or "facets", at times, to refer to POL's internal name for the
          various maps, <em>realms</em>.<br>
          <br>
          The region spawner will populate user defined regions in a realm with
          NPCs, reagents or items, from user defined groups. It is intended for
          large areas that need to be spawned with random NPCs or items. from
          predefined groups. For example, if you need to spawn a forest with
          "forest animals" you can define a group containing animals you might
          find in a forest. Then define the corners of the forest region and
          have your forest animals assigned to that region. <br>
          <br>
          You should familiarize yourself with the region spawner by reading the
          following guide or keep the guide open in your browser to refer to.<br>
          <br>
          Use the command <b>.spawner</b> to open the region spawner (spawn
          system) gump.<br>
        </big>
        <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><big><big style="font-weight: bold;">The
            region spawner gump:<br>
          </big></big><big>The gump has a menu on the left and the working area
          on the right. When you first open it the working area shows the list
          of facets (realms) that have been added to the spawn system. In the
          example above you can see that Felucca (britannia) and Trammel
          (britannia_alt) have been added to the list of</big><big> facets&nbsp;
        </big><big>to be s</big><big>pawned.</big><br>

          <br>
          <b>The Add Realm gump:</b><br>
          To add a facet, left-click on the Add Realm button and you will see a
          list of available facets that can be added. As you click each button
          of the additional facets you want to add, the facet you chose will be
          removed from the list of available facets. To return to the realm
          (facet) list, click on the Realm List in the menu on the left.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="spawnerGumpAddRealm.jpg" alt=""><br>
          <br>
          <b>The Regions List gump:</b><br>
          To view the regions defined for a facet, or realm, click on the button
          next to the facet. The Felucca facet (britannia realm) has predefined
          regions as you can see in the following example.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="spawnerGumpRegionList.jpg" alt=""><br>
          <br>
          <b>The Region Information gump:</b><br>
          To view the information about a particular region, click the button
          next to that region. From here you can go to the region center, delete
          the region or view the group settings for that region. You can rename
          the region. You can change the spawn wait time. That is the time
          between each spawn cycle. The region spawner will, at the appropriate
          time, check a region and if the NPC count for each group in that
          region. If the group's NPC count is less than the maximum, region
          spawner will replace any missing NPCs for that group. If you choose to
          delete the region, you will be prompted to confirm the delete. If you
          make any changes, click the Apply button for those changes to take
          place. To add groups to the region, click on the Regions List button.
          Then find your new region in the list and click its button.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="spawnerGumpRegionInfo.jpg" alt=""><br>
          <br>
          <b>The Group Settings gump:</b><br>
          Here are the group settings for the brigand_fort region. You can add a
          group to spawn in this region by clicking on a button next to an empty
          group name. If you click on a button next to a defined group, that
          group will be removed from that region. You will <b><i>not</i></b> be
          asked to confirm the removal of the group. It will simply be removed.
          If you add another group to a region, insure that you set a Max Amount
          of entries from the group to spawn, up to 999, and check the Enabled
          check box is checked. Always remember to click the Apply button after
          making any changes.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="spawnerGumpGroupSettings.jpg" alt=""><br>
        </big><big><br>
          <b>The Add Region gump:</b><br>
          You can also define new regions for a facet. Note that you need to
          select a facet in order to have this option, and Regions List
          available. Before you add a region to the spawn system you need to
          know the coordinates for the North-West X and Y (X1, Y1) and
          South-East X an Y (X2, Y2) of that region. Go to the North-West corner
          and enter the .whereat command. Target the NW corner and enter the X
          and Y coordinates in X1 and Y1 respectively. Now do the same for the
          SE corner but enter the X and Y in X2 and Y2. Now decide on a name for
          this region and then decide what the delay should be between spawns of
          this region. Click Apply. You now have a new region, ready for you to
          add groups to it.<strong></strong><br>

          <br>
          <br>
          <b>The Group List gump:</b><br>
          The region spawner spawns an area using groups of NPCs. These groups
          can be user defined. However there are some predefined groups for the
          developer to choose from. To see the defined groups click on the Group
          List button. To view a particular group, click on the button next to
          its name.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="spawnerGumpGroupList.jpg" alt=""><br>
          <br>
          <b>The Group Information gump:</b><br>
          Here you can see the initial group information for the desertt2a
          group. From here you can choose the Spawn Engine used to spawn that
          region. I will have more to say on the Spawn Engines later. You can
          also delete the group. If you choose to delete a group you will be
          prompted to confirm your desire to delete the group before it is
          deleted. The last thing, and the most important thing, is you can view
          the group entries. These are the things in a group that you wish to
          spawn in that region, in this case, desert NPCs.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="spawnerGumpGroupInfo.jpg" alt=""><br>
          <br>
          <b>The Group Entries gump:</b><br>
          You can create groups of NPCs, items or reagents. I will refer mostly
          to NPCs when talking about groups. Once you have decided on the type
          of things you want to spawn, choose the appropriate Spawn Engine. If
          you forget to choose an engine, the group is invalid and will not
          save. These are the current entries for the group desertt2a. Note you
          may add NPCs to the group. You may also remove NPCs from the group by
          clicking in the entry and backspacing to delete the NPC. Press Apply
          if you make any changes.<br>
          <br>

          I think that covers most of setting up a region. If you find I have
          missed anything or made a mistake, feel free to contact the POL Distro
          Team or make the addition or correction yourself and submit a pull
          request on GitHub.<br>
