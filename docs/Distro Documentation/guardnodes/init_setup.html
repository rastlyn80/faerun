Use the .create command to create guard nodes, .create guardnode<br>
This will create the guard node at your feet.<br>
If you do not see the guard node use the .info command on yourself and
click on the blue button by Privileges and make sure seeinvisitems is
enabled.<br>
If you wish to target the location to create the guard node use
.createat guardnode<br>
</font><br>
<font style="font-size: 16pt;" size="4">Guard nodes must be setup in a grid in all guard protected cities if
you wish to cover the entire city.<br>
<br>
To cover a town or an area completely follow the instructions below:<br>
Since guard nodes have a listen range of 30 tiles diameter, they should
be placed in the following manner:<br>
Place nodes from the west side of town to the east<br>
Find the town border and travel east 30 tiles.<br>
Then find the north border and travel south 30 tiles<br>
Place a node there. The node will spawn its own guard.<br>
Now travel 60 tiles south and place another node (30 tile radius for
each node)<br>
Continue until you reach the south border of the town.<br>
Any guard nodes that extend past the town border will only work within
the actual town limits, so you do not have to worry about extending
past town limits.<br>
Guard zones are defined in config/gzone.cfg.<br>
For each node you have placed continue the above grid to the east till
you hit the east edge of town.<br>
Once you fill in the grid, your town will be completely covered.<br>
<br>
You can use (double-click) on the guard node to bring up a gump with
various settings:<br>

If you have different types of guards you can change the guard type.<br>

You can set the number of guards spawned by the node.<br>

Select the Respawn Gards check box if you want to respawn the guards.<br>

You can disable and enable the node. This is helpful for special events
when you do not want guards around. When the node is enabled it will be
a dark red, when disabled it will be a light green.<br>

Remember that any changes made in the gump will not take effect until
you click the Apply button.</big><br>
