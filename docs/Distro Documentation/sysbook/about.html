<h2 style="text-align: center;">About the sysbook package:</h2>
</div>
<div id="content"><big id="fred">The sysbook package is in reality two
halves of a whole books package. The first half provides a way to have
blank books for players to write stories, create lists of merchandise
or whatever they wish to put in a book. The other half of the sysbook
package allows developers to create books containing stories or other
written content. The content can be about the shard, for background and
role-play purposes, guides for various skills or anything you want your
players to be able to read in-game. The books created with content or
stories can be added to the sysbook library configuration file and to
the data file. This package allows you to have these books spawn
randomly in bookshelves of your choice. In order for one of these books
to spawn in a bookshelf the book must be transferred to the
configuration file, master_library.cfg located in the sysbook config directory.
This is the “Master Library”. The books stored in the Master Library
cannot be deleted by any command. Once they are added to the Master
Library they can be added to the shard_library data file, referred to in this documentation as the Shard
Library. There are commands to add or remove books to, or from, the
Shard Library. Elements cannot be deleted from the Master Library by
eScript programmes. It must be edited in a text editor. Thus only a
developer will be able to delete books from the Master Library. I
provide a list of the commands and their descriptions to the left in the menu.</big><br>
<hr><big>A quick note about the Master and Shard Libraries: This was
inspired, well more than inspired, suggested, by Nando. So a big thank
you to him. The Master Library, as it is for the most part permanent,
allows a developer or admin to add books for use at various times of
the year or for special events without them spawning in the bookshelves
until they are added to the Shard Library. Books in the Master Library
cannot be created in-game, either by commands or by the book spawn
system. To make a book from the Master Library available in-game it
must first be added to the Shard Library. See the sysbook commands
section.<br>
