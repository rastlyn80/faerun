      <div id="content"><big>This
          is an attempt to document everything you need to know to set-up,
          configure, modify, and maintain a POL server based on the Distro. As
          this is a monumental undertaking it will be a work in progress for
          some
          time and will probably go through several revisions before, and if
          ever, it is finished. A special thanks to Austin for his attributes
          system documentation. I am using it as a "template" for the Distro
          docs as I do not know enough about HTML coding to get fancy and create
          my own pages yet.</big><br>
        <hr><big>The Distro is intended to be a starting
          point for those who wish to have a functioning basic set of scripts
          (eScript programs) that can be expanded as you see fit. It will
          attempt
          to have the functionality that is available in the UO client in so far
          as that is possible.</big><br>
