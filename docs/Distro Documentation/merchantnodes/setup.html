            node:</big><br>
          To install a merchant node, you must know the following information
          before you begin:<br>
          Largest radius of the room to monitor. This can be determined by
          standing in the exact center of the room and counting the tiles to the
          furthest wall. Keep in mind that the nodes check line of sight. So for
          buildings that are not rectangular, you must base your centering on
          the assumption that the building is rectangular. Once you have your
          radius, you must create your NPCs.<br>
          <br>
          Note that merchant NPCs are designed to be permanent and should <span

            style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> be created by the .createnpc
          command or a spawn point. Use the .createnode command to begin setting
          up the node.<br>
          <br>
        </big>
        <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><big><big style="font-weight: bold;">The
            Create Node gump:<br>
          </big></big><b><img src="images/Createnode.jpg" alt=""><br>
        </b><big><br>
          The createnode gump is pretty straight forward.<br>
          <br>
          The "Listen Range" field is the radius around the node that it will
          respond to speech commands.The default distance is 15 <br>
          The "Respawn Time" field is the amount of time between respawning a
          merchant or banker should the NPC be killed. The default time is 60
          minutes.<br>
          The "Restock Time" field is the time between vendors being restocked.
          Each NPC will restock their inventory on that interval. The default time
          is 60 minutes.<br>
          Once all the relevant information is entered, click the "APPLY"
          button.<br>
          <br>
          You will get a target cursor. This is for placing the node. Place the
          node at the center of the room, even if it is within a wall or outside
          the actual building.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Using the node:</span></big><br>
          Once the node is created, double-click on it and a gump will appear. </big><big>If
          you do not see the node, use the .info command and target yourself.
          Click the blue button next to Pivileges. In the list of privileges
          click the blue button next to seeinvisitems to enable seeing invisible
          items.<br>
          <br>
        </big><big>Before we look at the gump in detail, let's spawn your first
          merchant. There is a button at the bottom of the gump, next to the
          CANCEL button, labelled "Add Merchant". Click on that to create a
          merchant. The gump will disappear and you will be asked to enter the
          type of merchant you wish to spawn. Enter alchemist and press
          &lt;enter&gt;. You will receive a target cursor. Choose where you wish
          the merchant to appear. The node will spawn the merchant at that
          location and the gump will reappear momentarily.<br>
          <br>
          There are occasions when you might want more than one merchant in a
          shop or location. So to place another merchant, repeat the procedure
          above.<br>
          <br>
        </big>
        <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big>The
              Merchant Node "use" gump:</big></big></span><big><big><br>
          </big></big><img src="images/Merc%20Node%20Use.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <br>
        <big>This is an example of a merchant node gump. At the top left, next
          to the label "Current", you see the number of enabled merchants on the
          left side of the slash and the total number of merchants created by
          this node on the right. In this case three enabled of three created.
          The node has been used to spawn three merchants, a tailor, a mage, and
          an alchemist. You can see it shows the merchant type and its location.<br>
          <br>
          Near the bottom left side of the gump, above the APPLY button is the
          "Node Enabled" button. This allows you to enable or disable a node.
          Clicking this button, if the node is enabled, will disable the node
          and remove merchants attached to the node from the world. When a node
          is disabled it will be colored a dark green and the text next to the
          button will display "Node Disabled" in red. Clicking the button on the
          gump for a disabled node will enable it and respawn the merchants.<br>
          <br>
          On the right side of the gump, in the white area, are two buttons. The
          "Restock Merchants" button will resupply all merchants attached to the
          node with their inventory to sell. The respawn merchants button will
          respawn any merchants that might have been killed by players This can
          be useful during quests.<br>
          <br>
          On the bottom of the gump, near the middle is the node settings
          button. This will open the node settings gump you saw when you used
          the .createnode gump. Please note that if you open the node settings
          and modify the listen range, the new setting will not take effect
          until the server is restarted. This is a POL system limitation.<br>
          <br>
          Now let's take a look at the check-boxes and buttons that affect
          individual merchants.<br>
          There are two check boxes next to each merchant listed, "Enabled" and
          "Restock". Merchants are automatically enabled when you add them. This
          means they are placed in the world, have their wares ready to sell,
          and will respond to speech commands. If the merchant is enabled the
          Enabled check box will have a check mark. To disable a merchant click
          on the check box and click the APPLY button in the lower left.
          Disabling a merchant will remove it from the game world but not from
          the node.This can be useful when you wish to setup nodes with certain
          merchants that are only available at certain times such as during
          quests. The Restock check-box will refresh a vendor's stock of goods
          to sell to players. To restock a vendor, click on the check-box and
          click APPLY. As these are check-boxes, you can select a check-box for
          multiple merchants.<br>
          <br>
          There are two buttons to the right of the check-boxes "Delete" and
          "Customize". Clicking the Delete button will delete that merchant from
          the world, and the node. To delete a merchant, click the Delete
          button. The merchant will be deleted immediately. <b>This operation
            cannot be undone.</b><br>
          <br>
          The button to the far right of a merchant is the Customize button.
          This is a new feature in the merchant node system. It allows the
          customization of certain characteristics of a merchant. <br>
          <br>
        </big><big><big style="font-weight: bold;">The Customize gump:</big></big><br>
        <img src="images/Edit%20Merchant.jpg" alt=""><br>
        <big><br>
          In this gump you can assign a static name to this vendor. The vendor
          will retain this name even if it is killed and respawns. You can also
          choose whether you want to have this vendor spawn as a male, female or
          a random gender You can also choose whether this vendor will respawn
          with a random skin hue and a random speech color. Keep in mind, if you
          do assign a static name to the merchant, do not forget to assign a
          static gender appropriate for the name.</big> Click the OK button when
        you are done or the X to cancel.<br>
