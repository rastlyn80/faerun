            When a staff member of <strong>councilor</strong> level or higher
            logs in, the help queue gump will appear. This gump allows staff to
            respond to help requests that might have been made but are still
            awaiting a response from staff. Typing the command <strong>.helpqueue</strong>
            will also bring up the help queue gump.<br>
            Here is an example of the help queue gump where a player thinks he
            found a bug<br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/helpqueue01.jpg" alt=""><br>
            <br>
            If the button next to the player’s name is clicked you will be
            presented with options in the lower section of the gump as well as
            the complete message.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="images/helpqueue02.jpg" alt=""><br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            You can go to the character, summon the character to your location,
            review the player’s account information, activate the info command
            to review the character’s info, send a message to the character, or
            delete the page. Most of those options are self-explanatory but a
            little explanation is necessary regarding the message option. When
            you message the character, the character can send a one-time
            response. This option is not a chat system. There are enough third
            party chat systems that can be used for extended conversations and
            they are much more flexible and feature rich than could be written
            for in-game use.<br>
