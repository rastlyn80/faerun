        <h2 style="text-align: center;">What happens when a player buys a house?</h2>
      </div>
      <div id="content"><big><big>When a player double-clicks on a For
            Sale sign she is presented with a gump asking if she wants to buy
            the house. If she clicks "Yes" the system looks first in her
            backpack to see if she has the required gold to purchase the house.
            If not, the system checks her bank chest for the required gold.
            Assuming she has the gold either in her backpack or in the bank, the
            system will subtract the gold from the appropriate place and she
            will take possession of the house. I did not program the system to
            combine the two sources to see if her total gold, backpack and bank
            chest, equaled the purchase price of the house.<br>
            <br>
            Once the gold the gold is removed she is given two keys, one is
            placed in her backpack and one in her bank chest.&nbsp; This system
            differs from the World of Dreams static housing system because a</big></big><big><big>
            deed for the house is also placed in her bank chest. The deed allows
            her to sell her house, using the secure trading gump, to another
            player if she so desires.<br>
            <br>
            She or a co-owner must either use the house sign or walk into the
            house before the decay time expires. The setting RefreshTime in the
            static housing settings determines the number of real life days are
            allowed before a house "decays" and is returned to a "For Sale"
            state.<br>
