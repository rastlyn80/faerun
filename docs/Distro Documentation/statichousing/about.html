            OVERVIEW:</span><br>
          This package is written in such a way that you can provide unattended
          purchasing of houses by players. For servers<br>
          with limited online staff, unattended purchasing doesn't require
          players to page a GM and wait around to<br>
          buy a house. This requires staff to plot, or "pre-deed" the static
          houses you want to make available for unattended purchase. Pre-deeding
          is not required. Players can page a staff member and houses can be
          deeded on demand if you wish but players appreciate being able to buy
          a house without staff intervention. For role play shards pre-deeded
          houses that can be bought without staff intervention are very
          important because it allows for more immersive game play.<br>
