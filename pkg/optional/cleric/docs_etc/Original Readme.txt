Clerics by Austin Heilman

Background: 
This is a clerical package. It is based on Sigismund's original clerical
package.

Installation: Extract the files in the zip to a folder in pkg/std/cleric
Copy secretdoors.cfg to your pol/config folder.

You will also need to have my poison watcher package installed for any
curing rites, or special effect rites such as true seeing and sanctuary
you can get those specific plugs for the package on the pol script forum.

Any missing includes (equipment.inc, unmount.inc) can be found on the
pol script forum's include area.

Append the npcdesc.cfg to your npcdesc.cfg and copy the AI script to where you
keep your AI scripts. If its something other than scripts/ai you will need to
adjust the script line in the npcdesc.cfg

For instructions to making new rites, I think the best thing to do would
be to read the rites.cfg file and look at how I scripted other rites.
Those are the only 2 steps necessary to create a rite.

A big thanks goes to Paul Mosher, also known as Gambrinus.
I could not have done it without his many ideas for the rites
and to Sigismund, for writing the original cleric system, which
I used the ideas from in some ways, such as canons, symbols and focci.
