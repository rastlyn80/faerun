A note regarding the Focus skill.

According to uoguide.com the Focus skill has a chance to gain every time the stamina or mana vitals regenerate by any amount.
This means that during regeneration Focus has a chance of gaining multiple times until those vitals are fully restored.
The Focus skill package, as it is currently written, works as it is supposed to as described on uoguide.com.

There is a possibility, on a heavily populated server, that this method might produce excessive server load.
If you find this is happening on your server, you can use the alternate Focus package contained in fauxFocus.zip.
It reduces the possibility of server load but does not perform Focus skill gains as described on uoguide.com.
The "faux Focus" system starts a script that runs every random number of seconds which runs a Focus skill check on all
online players.

To use the faux Focus package, replace all files in the current Focus package with the contents of fauxFoucus.zip.
