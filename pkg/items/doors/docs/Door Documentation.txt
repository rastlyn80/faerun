This is the doors package documentation.

So far, it only contains info about how the dismount tiles work for doors.
The doors package has a settings file in :doors:settings.cfg. In this file
there is a setting, DismountCharacter, which, when set, enables the door
use script to place a dismount tile at any exterior door in a house.
It is currently disabled.

I must confess that this capability was added for personal reasons
I was introduced to Ultima Online on a fairly strict role playing
free shard. It used to annoy me when players would ride their horses into
their houses. In real life you would bang your head on the top of the door
jamb if you did that. So, being from a role play shard, I decided to add
the capability to dismount players who try to enter houses whilst mounted.
