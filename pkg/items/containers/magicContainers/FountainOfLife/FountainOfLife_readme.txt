The Fountain of Life

The Fountain of Life is a "magical" fountain that will transform
regular bandages into Enhanced Bandages. Enhanced Bandages enhance
your healing skill when used.

The Fountain of Life will transform up to 10 normal bandages in a
24 hour period.

See the settings.cfg file in /pkg/items/containers/magicContainers/FountainOfLife/config
for the delay time between transforming regular bandages to Enhanced Bandages, the
maximum amount of bandages that will be converted and the healing bonus that Enhanced
Bandages will give to the healing skill.
