Bountiful Chest

The Bountiful Chest is a special container that will "magically" increase the amount
of a plant based reagent, example Nightshade, that is placed inside. The chest will
only accept ten reagents to be duplicated and the reagents cannot be bundles (stacks).
In otherwords, one Nightshade, not a stack of Nightshade. Ten individual Nightshade
plants can be placed in the chest but not a bundle of ten Nightshades. The Bountiful
Chest only accepts plant based reagents and only in single quantities per plant.

With the current settings it will only accept a maximum of 10 single reagent plants.
It will duplicate a reagent once every 2 hours and 24 minutes (one tenth of a real day).
So if you drop a plant, for example Mandrake Root, in the chest and leave it there for
24 hours, the chest will create 10 additional Mandrake Roots. The maximum duplicates is 10.
Each plant's delay starts when it is placed in the chest. Plants placed at different
times will have different spawn times based upon when they were placed in the chest.

The settings.cfg file in :BountifulChest/config has settings for the limits and time
between duplicating a reagent.

Please note that this was written specifically for the Modern Distro. If you wish to
use it in your shard, and your shard is not based on the latest Modern Distro, you will
need to look at the reagents pkg in /pkg/items/resources/reagents for additional
custom members and methods that were added to simplify the Bountiful Chest package.
